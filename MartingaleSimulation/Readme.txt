Martingale Simulation

This is a simple simulation of the Martingale strategy.
The strategy is primarily used for gambling, specifically on 50/50 bets (or close to it).

The Martingale betting system essentially tries to accumulate the user specified amount before going bankrupt.

The strategy is to keep doubling your bet each time you lose. By doing this, you
are eventually going to turn a profit when you win. However, that profit will always be your initial bet.

Ex: you start with a $5 bet, you lose 3 times in a row, your 4th bet would need to be $40. 
    This is because you previously lost $5, then $10, then $20, $40 will ensure you make 
	your money back plus however much your initial bet was.
