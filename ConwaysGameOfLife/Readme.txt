Conway's Game of Life

Project Description:
This is a simple program that showcases Conway's Game of Life.
I set up a 2D board with living cells on it, with each iteration of the board, a new 
generation of cells will spawn. The way a cell is spawned is based off a couple of rules:

	1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
	2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
	3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
	4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
